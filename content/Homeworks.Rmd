## Homework protocol

Each will be turned in via email to a box.com address specific to the take home. For each you will need to attach to the email 1) an rmd or a rnw file of your code and answers and 2) a pdf of said file. Use your last name to label the files (e.g,. “Jackson_takehome1”) and include your name as part of the document front-/top-matter.

All take home projects are INDEPENDENT projects; do not share code or answers.

Note: In some instances I describe doing a question “by hand,” which means using the formulas to calculate the answers. This is contrasted with the simpler way of using R functions. It is recommended to use R functions if the “by hand” method is not explicitly stated; quicker & simpler is often preferred.
